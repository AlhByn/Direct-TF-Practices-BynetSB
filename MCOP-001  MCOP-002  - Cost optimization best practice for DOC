Constant cost optimization strategy is applied. Every workload needs to answer specific questions: 
1)	Is this workload needed? 
2)	Is the workload performing well under current conditions? 
3)	Can we change configuration of it to save on costs?
Those questions are repeated periodically through weeks, months, years of application usage.

Establish a well-defined process for estimating the initial costs of an AWS solution. This process should take into account various factors, such as infrastructure, data transfer, and services used.
Use AWS Cost Calculator Tools:

Leverage AWS tools like the AWS Pricing Calculator and the AWS Simple Monthly Calculator to estimate costs based on resource usage, instance types, storage, data transfer, and more.
Understand Pricing Models:

Gain a deep understanding of AWS pricing models, which can vary depending on the service. Be aware of the on-demand, reserved instances, and spot instance pricing, as well as data transfer, storage, and other cost components.
Leverage AWS Cost Explorer:

Utilize AWS Cost Explorer to analyze historical usage and costs. It provides insights into cost trends and can help identify areas where optimization is needed.
Set Up Billing Alarms:

Configure billing alarms in AWS Billing and Cost Management to receive alerts when costs exceed predefined thresholds. This helps in cost monitoring and control.
Use AWS Trusted Advisor:

AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations for optimizing AWS resources and reducing costs. Review its cost optimization recommendations regularly.
Implement Resource Tagging:

Tag resources with meaningful labels and categories to allocate costs and track spending by project, department, or application. This helps in cost attribution.
Estimate Data Transfer Costs:

Be aware of data transfer costs, especially when data needs to be transferred between regions or outside of AWS. Use the AWS Data Transfer Calculator to estimate these costs accurately.
Implement Cost Allocation Tags:

Implement cost allocation tags on AWS resources to assign costs to specific projects, departments, or teams. This makes it easier to provide detailed cost models to customers.
Review and Optimize Regularly:

Regularly review AWS usage and spending, and continuously optimize resources to reduce unnecessary costs. Use AWS Trusted Advisor and Cost Explorer to identify opportunities for optimization.
Provide Transparent Cost Models:

Before implementing any AWS solution, provide a detailed and transparent cost model to the customer. This should include estimates for infrastructure, service usage, data transfer, and any other cost components.
Educate Customers:

Ensure that customers are educated about AWS pricing models and the impact of their choices on costs. This includes understanding the difference between on-demand and reserved instances, data storage costs, and the importance of stopping or terminating unused resources.
Monitor and Adjust:

Continuously monitor actual costs against the estimated model and adjust it based on evolving usage patterns. Provide ongoing cost reports to customers to keep them informed.
Optimize for AWS Cost Reductions:

Take advantage of AWS cost-reduction opportunities, such as Reserved Instance purchases, spot instances, and using cost-effective storage options, to minimize expenses.
Implement Budgets and Reports:

Set up AWS Budgets and cost reports to track spending against predefined budgets. This provides early visibility into potential cost overruns.
